# Offer App

This project is an Offer App, which uses http://api.fyber.com/ to retrieve data from api.
In the app there is a form, which user should fill in. For simplicity it is prefilled with default values. When "Search" button is pressed, user is navigated to different screen with an offers list.
To add, the app also checks the signature of each response and stops retrieving data if the signature wrong.

The project uses Java language, MVVM pattern, rxJava, recyclerView, paging, Dagger Hilt, Retrofit.
